# ECG-Anomaly-Detection
Autoencoders for anomaly detection in ECG readings

For this assignment, 3 different variations of an Autoencoder were applied to ECG readings to identify arrhythmia in patients.
* Shallow Autoencoder
* Lasso-regularised Autoencoder
* Undercomplete Autonecoder
* Dropout Autoencoder

For each of these, their train-validation loss was plotted and a confusion matrix for the predictions on the test set were plotted
